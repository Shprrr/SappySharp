# SappySharp
A port of Kawa's original Sappy 2006 ([Original code](https://github.com/Touched/Sappy)) to C#. The original code is in VB6 so the goal is to port the application to a more recent framework.

## Development Stages
- [x] 1. Compile ported code to C#.
- [ ] 2. Fix bugs to make it work.
- [ ] 3. Refactor code for newer patterns and more perfomance.
- [ ] 4. Adding new features (if any).
